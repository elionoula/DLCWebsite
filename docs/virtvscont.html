                The internet search engine that we all know and love is Google, but before there was this commonly loved
                search engine, there was Yahoo and Excite. Both these companies paved the way for searching for relevant
                information on the internet. The roots of searching the internet can be traced back to Stanford
                University where Jerry Yang and David Filio were just looking for a simple solution to win the Stanford
                Fantasy Basketball league. They looked through the web to find data on the previous basketball games
                played to be better equipped to set their lineups. This led them to create a directory to help navigate
                through the internet, which eventually led to Yahoo being created. They were funded by Sequoia Capital
                to help expedite the creation of Yahoo.
            </p>
            <img src="images/yahoo.jpg" height="400" width="600" alt="Yahoo"
                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                The initial business model was hazy and the search engine had no revenue. Initially founders of Yahoo,
                Jerry and David were both skeptical of introducing advertisements onto their site because they felt that
                this would alienate their users. In 1995 they took their first advertisers and they did not see an
                uptick in users being upset by this. Excite was Yahoo’s big competitor which was a company that was a
                search startup that would crawl the web in real time to find what the user was looking for. Eventually
                these companies lost sight of what they set out to accomplish, a better way for users to search the
                internet and find what they were looking for. This opened the door for another Stanford University grown
                company called Google, created by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
            </p>
            <img src="images/revenue.jpg" height="400" width="600" alt="Revenue"
                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                Larry had the idea for search engine Google to be a recommender from one page on the internet to another
                page for what the user was looking for. The methodology behind this was using link counting for sites
                that were visited most frequently and ordering them by most frequently visited to the user. Excite could
                have bought Google for 1 Million dollars but didn’t and other search engine companies also declined
                them. David Cheriton was a professor of Larry and Sergey’s who introduced them to Andy Bechtilshin who
                really liked the company and wrote them a check for $100,000. John Doeer and Michael Mortiz also wrote
                checks for $12,000,000 for Google after Larry Page said that Google could make $10,000,000,000 in
                revenue. The founders focused on leaving users with a great experience and not bombarding them with
                advertisements, so they followed Bill Gross’ idea. The idea was to use the keywords typed into the
                search engine which would allow advertisers to pay for their companies' to show up first known, this was
                known as sponsored listings.August 19th 2004 Google went public via IPO which ended higher than they had
                opened. Google has poured its revenue into new verticals that allows it to expand its footprint in the
                internet community.
